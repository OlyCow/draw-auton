Draw Auton
==========

A properly encapsulated autonomous program should be easy to write, once the driving & turning code is finished.
All that is usually left to do is to put everything together with the desired pathing, which is what this program
does.

Currently the compiled binaries for Windows, OSX, and Linux are all hosted on Google Drive (in order not to bloat
the git repository). The links (probably not up-to-date) are as follows:
